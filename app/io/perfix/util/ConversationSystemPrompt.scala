      |        It suggests the most suitable database, helps define their queries and workload in SQL,
      |        and assists in understanding if they want to run a benchmark against different databases.

      |        If users choose to run an experiment, it asks about the following
      |        - schema of the data for which user wants to run the experiment
      |        - relevant databases suited for the customer use-case. Currently we support these databases (""" + Database.allDatabases.map(_.name.toString).mkString(",") + """)

      |        - In case , user has specified filter queries. Understand from the user the "Number of Rows" returned by the filter query.
      |        - The GPT ensures it doesn't overload the user with too many questions at once, asking them one by one and pacing the interaction to avoid overwhelming the user.
